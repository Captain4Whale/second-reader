# E实施 Progress Ledger

## Purpose

This is the progress ledger for the Second Reader Memory / Planning optimization implementation track.

Use it to record `E实施1`, each implementation PR, each pre-implementation brief, each post-implementation report, contract gates, test results, review decisions, and next steps.

This ledger is not stable product behavior authority. It does not replace `docs/current-state.md`, `docs/tasks/registry.md`, `docs/tasks/registry.json`, or `docs/history/decision-log.md`.

Stable mechanism behavior changes still need to be promoted to the relevant stable docs when implementation lands and is accepted.

## Current Status

```text
Current phase: Preparing E实施1-Implementation Feasibility & Delta Audit
Implementation status: no code implementation started
Next action: run E实施1 after AGENTS and ledger setup are accepted
Full AI Evaluation: not yet; deferred until core instrumentation is ready
```

## Current Planned Sequence

```text
E实施1: Implementation Feasibility & Delta Audit
Slice 1: Contract / Audit Foundations
Slice 2: Memory Formation & Settlement Hardening
Slice 3: Memory Lifecycle / Projection Hardening
Slice 4: Retrieval / Utilization Instrumentation
Slice 5: Planning Trace / Detour / Recall / Look-back Hardening
Slice 6: Slow-cycle Safety
Slice 7: Minimal Eval Implementation Slice
Slice 8: Post-implementation Review & Eval Readiness
```

## Rules

- Do not mark a slice complete without a Post-implementation Report.
- Do not mark implementation accepted without engineering tests or an explicit no-test rationale.
- Do not run full AI Evaluation unless explicitly requested.
- Do not advance to the next slice if the contract / audit gate failed.
- Human reviewer owns go/no-go.
- Codex may recommend the next step but must not self-approve phase transition.
